# Song-recommendation-system
This project develops a system which recommends the user a list of songs based on userâ€™s current emotion level, their history of songs, genres of songs the user has listened, through machine learning algorithms. => FindEmotion_maxWord.ipynb
It also tries to improve the emotional condition of the user by analyzing the percentage of emotion level of the song and suggesting slightly better songs.
Also, a feedback is maintained to check if the user is interested in the suggested song and improve the recommendation system accordingly. => RecommendationSystem.ipynb
